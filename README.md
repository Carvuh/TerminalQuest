### Welcome *Adventurerer*... to
# Terminal Quest!

Okay, yeah, that was kind of dumb. Hey guys! I'm currently just trying to learn Python to place on my CV and I thought, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if I could just make a game or something? Ever since "Bash On Ubuntu On Windows" (Real name, I swear...) came out, I thought it would be the best time.

I'll eventually make a wiki and would love for the community to get into this stuff!

I might *redo* the name... who knows. I think TerminalQuest is already the name of something? Hmm, later I suppose.
