### Welcome *Adventurerer*... to
# Terminal Quest!

Okay, yeah, that was kind of dumb. Hey guys! I'm currently just trying to learn Python to place on my CV and I thought, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if I could just make a game or something? Ever since "Bash On Ubuntu On Windows" (Real name, I swear...) came out, I thought it would be the best time.

I'll eventually make a wiki and would love for the community to get into this stuff!

I might *redo* the name... who knows. I think TerminalQuest is already the name of something? Hmm, later I suppose.

# What is *TerminalQuest*?

TerminalQuest, created by [@Carvuh](http://www.twitter.com/Carvuh) -- Justin Carver, is just something I am doing in my spare time as I stated above. I'm pretty much doing this to deepen my knowledge in Python and hopefully get something going that future people can contribute to. Players can choose whatever they wanted to be. Using only text, players can explore forgotten realms, unexplored planes, and do whatever they can to become the adventurer they have alwayed wanted to be.

This game will be EXTREMELY easy to mod. Just fork the repo, change the source (*duh, of course*) and CSV files to fit your need, and you will be pretty much on your way. I am trying to make this as modular as possible, though, keep a fantasy aspect in mind.

The game will be driven by a fantasy DungeonMaster that will handle all RNG and NPC driven madness that will away you in what needs to happen. Hopefully the community can create extra classes that are balanced and make sense in a fantasy environment (or whatever you choose).

# HELP ME, I'M SO LOST

Do not fret, my child. Soon... there will be a wiki. But until then, take a look at all of these things that I have here.
